This is a **Fabric-based (MC 1.21)** client-side mod that implements a fully autonomous agent. It goes beyond simple pathfinding by incorporating **Context Awareness** and a **Task Planning System**.

The core innovation is its custom **"Behavior Stack"** architecture, which translates abstract path nodes into atomic operation queues. It utilizes a **Multi-threaded Asynchronous Callback System** to execute physical interactions (mining, jumping, walking), ensuring the main game thread never freezes during complex tasks.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Custom A* Pathfinding Engine
* **Source:** `net.wtf.PathFinding.Astar`
* **Logic:** A custom implementation of the A* algorithm, specifically optimized for Minecraft's voxel environment. It features a custom `Heuristic Cost` and `G_cost` calculation.
* **3D Navigation:** Capable of handling complex 3D movement, including verticality logic like `JumpUpForward` and `JumpDown`, ensuring the bot can navigate uneven terrain.

### 2. "Wocao" Behavior Stack Architecture
* **Source:** `net.wtf.AutoRun.Wocao`
* **Translation Layer:** Features a unique "Translation Layer" that iterates through raw path nodes. It analyzes the relative position of the next node (e.g., `JumpUpForward`) and intelligently generates the corresponding operation sequence.
    * *Context Awareness Example:* If the movement is "Jump Forward", the system automatically checks for blocks above the player's head and inserts a `Break` operation if an obstruction is detected.
* **Atomic Operations:** Deconstructs complex behaviors into atomic units: `WAIT`, `WALK`, `BREAK`, `PLACE`, and `JUMP`.

### 3. Asynchronous Execution & Callback System
* **Source:** `net.wtf.AutoRun.*` (BreakBlock, Walking, etc.)
* **Thread Safety:** All physical interactions are offloaded to separate **Worker Threads**. This prevents the **Main Render Thread** from blocking (Black Screen issues) during time-consuming tasks like mining obsidian.
* **Event-Driven:** Utilizes a custom `Callback` interface (`onComplete`) to chain tasks. The next action in the queue is only triggered once the previous physical action has successfully completed.

## 🛠️ Commands & Usage

This mod registers client-side debug commands to trigger pathfinding and behavior execution.

### 1. Calculate Path
Sets the target coordinates and initiates the A* algorithm.
``mcfunction
wtf debug wtfAlgo <x> <y> <z> true
x, y, z: Target integer coordinates.
true: Confirm execution.
Visuals: Renders a green path line (RenderLine) and block outlines (BlockRender) in the world.

### 2. Execute Behavior QueueTranslates the calculated path into the behavior queue and begins execution.Code snippet/wtf debug StartWocao
The bot will automatically start moving, jumping, breaking blocks, or bridging gaps based on the plan.3. Debug Tools/wtf debug HighlightPos Jump/Forward/Down: Manually adds single actions to the render queue for testing the rendering system.
